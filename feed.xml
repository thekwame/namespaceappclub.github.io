      <description>&lt;p&gt;Namespace will be doing &lt;em&gt;public coding&lt;/em&gt; this Saturday, the 30th of May, 2015. 
What we call public coding is not a structured activity, it’s just a get together for developers to work on their personal projects but in a shared space. 
It’s an opportunity for you to meet and interact with your peers in the local software community while also getting stuff done.
There are no requirements, just show up, say hi and get to work. 
We would appreciate you stopping by even if you don’t have anything to work on as wed like to engage with as many people in our community as possible.
We’ll be meeting up at the Student Activity Centre at the UWI Campus in St. Augustine between 1pm and 6pm. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I know you read that already but I’m repeating it. Namespace is here
and ready to shake a tail feather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt I should make a post to explain Namespace as succinctly as possible, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an activity club for software developers and persons interested in the field
of software development and its related activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was not very brief was it? Let’s try again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespace puts together events and activities we hope people like you will enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You being the software developers of Trinidad and Tobago and potentially the wider Caribbean. Think of us as a co-ed network for devs or a Computer Society without the computers (just the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is to breathe some life into the local software industry. This is one
step toward resuscitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for more updates soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-namespace-&quot;&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;namespace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, we’re officially launching namespace - a club for software developers in Trinidad and Tobago. We’re a movement to remove the silos of people scattered throughout the nation that prevents us from build a community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-a-community-&quot;&gt;Why do we need a community?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? When like-minded people come together great things can happen. There are so many iniatitives happening but their reach may be limited. namespace will be the medium to create synergies amongst our divisions so that as a group we can create truly special experiences. It’s also a good crowd to have fun, there’s more to life than 1s and 0s :). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-namespace-way-of-life&quot;&gt;The namespace way of life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;namespace and all the activities we do come from these 5 pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to grow as software developers but we also want to grow as a people. As a club we do more than just the tech thing, a community is more than its common interests after all. That’s why our mantra is &lt;em&gt;require mixin&lt;/em&gt; - we’re all about bringing everyone together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-us-&quot;&gt;Join us!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a whole lot of things planned out for you, and we really believe we’ll all feel better about our profession and passion if we do it together. With namespace, local developers and enthusiasts will finally have that common ground - one module, no globals.&lt;/p&gt;
