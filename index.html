          <section class="content"><p>Namespace will be doing <em>public coding</em> this Saturday, the 30<span class="ord">th</span> of May, 2015. 
What we call public coding is not a structured activity, it’s just a get together for developers to work on their personal projects but in a shared space. 
It’s an opportunity for you to meet and interact with your peers in the local software community while also getting stuff done.
There are no requirements, just show up, say hi and get to work. 
We would appreciate you stopping by even if you don’t have anything to work on as wed like to engage with as many people in our community as possible.
We’ll be meeting up at the Student Activity Centre at the <span class="caps">UWI</span> Campus in St. Augustine between 1pm and 6pm. Hope to see you&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>Yes! I know you read that already but I’m repeating it. Namespace is here
and ready to shake a tail&nbsp;feather.</p>
<p>I felt I should make a post to explain Namespace as succinctly as possible, so here&nbsp;goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are an activity club for software developers and persons interested in the field
of software development and its related&nbsp;activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was not very brief was it? Let’s try&nbsp;again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespace puts together events and activities we hope people like you will&nbsp;enjoy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You being the software developers of Trinidad and Tobago and potentially the wider Caribbean. Think of us as a co-ed network for devs or a Computer Society without the computers (just the&nbsp;code).</p>
<p>Our goal here is to breathe some life into the local software industry. This is one
step toward&nbsp;resuscitation.</p>
<p>Look out for more updates&nbsp;soon!</p>

<p>Hi everyone, we’re officially launching namespace - a club for software developers in Trinidad and Tobago. We’re a movement to remove the silos of people scattered throughout the nation that prevents us from build a&nbsp;community. </p>
