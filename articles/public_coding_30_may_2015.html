          <section class="content"><p>Namespace will be doing <em>public coding</em> this Saturday, the 30<span class="ord">th</span> of May, 2015. 
What we call public coding is not a structured activity, it’s just a get together for developers to work on their personal projects but in a shared space. 
It’s an opportunity for you to meet and interact with your peers in the local software community while also getting stuff done.
There are no requirements, just show up, say hi and get to work. 
We would appreciate you stopping by even if you don’t have anything to work on as wed like to engage with as many people in our community as possible.
We’ll be meeting up at the Student Activity Centre at the <span class="caps">UWI</span> Campus in St. Augustine between 1pm and 6pm. Hope to see you&nbsp;there.</p>
